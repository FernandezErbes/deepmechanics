## deepmechanics

*deepmechanics* is a package for the solution of structural mechanics problems in Python using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). It is based on the Deep Energy Method [1] and implements a quadtree geometry with Gauss-Legendre quadrature for the computation of the functional (loss function) that is to be minimized.
